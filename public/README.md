- SVG (.svg)

## Supported Video Formats
- MP4 (.mp4) - Recommended

## How It Works
1. Any image or video files placed in this directory will automatically appear in the Media Gallery page
2. No need to upload through the UI - just add files directly to this folder
3. Media will be displayed in a carousel and gallery view

## Tips
- Use descriptive filenames for better organization
- Optimize your images and videos for web to reduce file size and improve loading times
- For videos, you can add a poster image with the same name (e.g., video.mp4 and video.jpg)
- Recommended image dimensions: 800x600 pixels or similar aspect ratio
- Recommended video resolution: 720p (1280x720) for a good balance of quality and file size
