# Images Directory

Place your image files in this directory to display them in the application.

## Supported Image Formats
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- GIF (.gif)
- WebP (.webp)
- SVG (.svg)

## How It Works
1. Any image files placed in this directory will automatically appear in the Images page of the application
2. No need to upload through the UI - just add files directly to this folder
3. Images will be displayed in a carousel and gallery view

## Tips
- Use descriptive filenames for better organization
- Optimize your images for web to reduce file size and improve loading times
- Recommended image dimensions: 800x600 pixels or similar aspect ratio
